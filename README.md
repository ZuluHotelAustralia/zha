### What is this repository for? ###

* Zulu Hotel Australia 2016
* Current version running on POL0.95

### How do I get set up? ###

* Scripts should just need to be downloaded (suggest sourcetree).
* Change the two executables from .exe.RENAME to just .exe (/pol.exe and /scripts/ecompile.exe)
* Open the ecompile.cfg folder in /scripts/ and relocate to match your OS folder structure.
* Modify /pol.cfg so that it points to your UO directory.
* Modify /config/servers.cfg so that the ip's match accordingly.
* Open a CMD prompt and navigate to the scripts folder and run ecompile.bat
* Once ecompile finishes go back up a level and run pol.exe
