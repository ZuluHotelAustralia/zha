/*
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED ON ZHA!!
 * This is POLHook's trigger system. If <phrase> is said ingame,
 * POLHook will replace it with <response>. If <display> is null,
 * POLHook won't forward <phrase> to POL, ie. you won't see the
 * original text ingame, only the response.
 *
 * Phrase has to be all lowercase because it's checked against tolower(text).
 * That means it is case insensitive.
 * Phrase is checked using strstr, that means "bank" is triggered with "banker" and
 * also with "let me see my bankbox", etc.
 * The Triggers are reloadable with ".reloadph".
